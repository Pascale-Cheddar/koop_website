				Hi, I'm Pascal, a highly motivated Junior Front-End Developer. <br /><br />
				My journey to becoming a computer scientist started with a completed apprenticeship as a carpenter and various
				jobs. But, during the Corona pandemic, I discovered the world of web development, and I realized that I wanted
				to continue to develop myself further. So, I spent a year learning with great enthusiasm, and the more I delved
				into it, the more I became passionate about it. That's when I decided to start my training as a computer
				scientist. <br /><br />
				I am an open-minded individual who is always eager to learn new things quickly. In my free time, I enjoy
				reading, Calisthenics (a mixture of strength training and gymnastics), meditation, and house dance. <br /><br />
				I believe that my ability to continuously face new challenges, as well as my excellent team-oriented and
				communication skills, make me a valuable addition to any team. I am convinced that my passion for technology and
				my willingness to constantly learn can contribute to the development of creative solutions and support the team
				on its path to success.
